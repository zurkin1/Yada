>Instructions for setup:

To run CIBERSORT software, please install relevant R libraries:

    1) 	Install R packages from within R:
    	install.packages('Rserve') 
    	install.packages('e1071')  
 	install.packages('parallel')
	install.packages('preprocessCore')
    	install.packages('colorRamps')  

    2) 	Start Rserve with option i or ii:
 
	i) Within R console:
	
	library(Rserve)

        	Rserve(args="--no-save")

	ii) From Unix shell:
		
		R CMD $PATH/Rserve --no-save

		where $PATH = location of Rserve executable

    3)	Make sure the 'lib' folder is in the same directory as the CIBERSORT.jar file.

    4) 	Run CIBERSORT using your own Mixture_File and Signature_Matrix, or use our example Mixture_File and Signature_Matrix [https://cibersort.stanford.edu/download.php].

	Examples for building your own Signature_Matrix will be coming soon.

    bash> java -Xmx3g -Xms3g -jar CIBERSORT.jar -M Mixture_File -B Signature_Matrix [Options]

    5)	The column field in the CIBERSORT output refers to a particular mixture in the input. Mixtures in the input are indexed from left to right, starting with 0, 1, 2, ...  


>Note:
At least 3 parallel threads required for Unix systems (1 thread for Windows systems)
At least 2GB RAM recommended, e.g. for 3GB:
java -jar -Xmx3g -Xms3g -jar CIBERSORT.jar ...

>Options:
Argument   Description (details or default value)
--------   --------------------------------------
-M File    [Required] Mixture file (GEP matrix: row 1 = sample labels; column 1 = gene symbols; no missing values)
-B File    Signature matrix file (Cell type GEP barcode matrix: row 1 = sample labels; column 1 = gene symbols; no missing values)
           *This argument supersedes -P and -c (below) which collectively are used to build a signature matrix
-P File    Purified sample file (Purified cell GEP matrix: row 1 = sample labels; column 1 = gene symbols; no missing values)
-c File    Phenotype classes (Each row: phenotype label followed by 1 (class of interest), 2 (compare against), or 0 (ignore))
-n Integer Set number of permutations for statistical analysis (100)
-v         Enable verbose output for web version (% complete for permutations and CIBERSORT)
-q [0-1]   Set q-value cutoff for differential expression analysis (0.3)
-k Integer Set maximum condition number, or kappa, for signature matrix (999)
-m Integer Set minimum number of DEGs to consider from each phenotype for signature matrix (50)
-x Integer Set maximum number of DEGs to consider from each phenotype for signature matrix (150)
-f         Filter non-hematopoietic genes from signature matrix during construction (False)
