Description: DeconSeq is an R package for deconvolution of
        heterogeneous tissues based on mRNA-Seq data. It modeled
        expression levels from heterogeneous cell populations in
        mRNA-Seq as the weighted average of expression from different
        constituting cell types and predicted cell type proportions of
        single expression profiles.
